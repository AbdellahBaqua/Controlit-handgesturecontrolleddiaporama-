Gesture & Speech Presentation Control
=======================================

Welcome to the documentation for the Gesture & Speech Controlled Presentation System, a computer vision educational project supervised by ENSAM AIDT departement chef , Mr. Masrour.

This project provides a robust, hands-free method for controlling slideshow presentations using a combination of computer vision and speech recognition. The system is designed for a presenter to navigate slides using specific hand gestures and voice commands, eliminating the need for a physical clicker.

This site will guide you through the installation process and how to use the application.
